The man ran without saying the thick and thin alley. Occasionally when the path is touched on the left and right side, like a hungry wild dog, he strokes his neck and jumps into one of the alleys as I thought after a stroll.
"I will be killed, I will be melted"
The man was frightened by the illusion.
In the muddy eyes the alley swelled like a badly reddish beast's intestine and it looked like it was swallowing swallowing yourself.
The man screams at the phobia of phantom but crawls further into that alley without stopping. We can not turn back. It was because I was convinced that nearby walls will scatter acid and stop everything without trace once it stops.
If you squeeze a man's brain now, Alcaloid will come out like a fruit juice. It was withdrawal symptoms due to plant narcotics, bad trip.
Oh, the footsteps approached.
I am going to melt.
