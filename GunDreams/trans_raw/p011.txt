"Ki Hiiri"
    The man ran away running the night the moonlight was illuminating.
    Alley of darkness without street lights. Squarre of a crap that dropped occasionally into the wall burned the darkness with a pale white light. The appearance of a man who runs in the blinking light and darkness floats like an animation, and it disappears.
     The man was a half-body cyborg who mechanized part of his head and his left arm. In the machine arms there was an old naught of a big swing, and a dark blood glucose was stained in it that glowed bluntly.
     Here is a zone away from the entertainment district of Kuzu Town, where only the dirty alleys, which are not popular, surround the gaps of buildings like capillaries.
