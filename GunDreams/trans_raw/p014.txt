Hallucinences are gone.
However, there was a reality that he pursued a man with hallucinations. Even if a man's consciousness awakens, its reality will not leave with hallucinations.

"Onoe is not a hallucination, is not it ... ... Damn it was Hanni-yume"
The shadow that was cut out from the darkness into a human form slowly comes out from the back of the alley with a hard footstep hitting the road surface. Then I crushed it tearingly dropping the rounded prize money list.
