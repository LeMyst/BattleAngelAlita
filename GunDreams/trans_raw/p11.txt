"Ki Hiiri"
    The man ran away running the night when the moonlight shone on.
    Alley of darkness without street lights. Sometimes the torpedo broken cup sparks burned the darkness with a pale white light. The light that diminishes and the figure of a man going crazy in the darkness float like an animation, and it disappears.
     The man was a half-body Saipog who mechanized part of his head and his left arm. In the machine arms there was an old naught of a big swing and a dark blood glucose was stained in it that glowed bluntly.
     Here is a zone away from the entertainment district of Kuzu Town, where only the dirty alleys, which are not popular, surround the gaps of buildings like capillaries.
