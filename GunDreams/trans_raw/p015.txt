"Do not think that hunting will be easy"
The man licked his blood in his right arm and hurt himself and set aside. Its stance entered Kanon because it passed through numerous scenes and there is no big gap.
The shadow cast a voice over the stance of the man and whispered in a low voice.
"Continuous murderers aiming at only women are going to be a nice tip ... but ... well, today you can do it well."
"Oh!"
The man was kicking the ground at the same time as he was fired up.
From leaping like a monkey who can not be regarded as a leg strength of a human being, a man shakes a bite over a shadow's crown in a letter. The left arm of the machine exerts powerful power, the tip of the accelerated Nata splits the air and emits a whistle like sound. It was a blow striking technique that a man buried many victims and pursuers.
At the moment when a man 's mortal sword touches the shadow' s crown, a glow glitters in the eyes of the shadow, receiving the dull light of Nata 's blade.
