"Ki Hiiri"

The man ran though the night, under the shining moon.
The alley was dark, without streetlights. Sometimes bright sparks created pools of light around entrances to the alley. But that light faded leaving the man to run madly through the darkness, like the after image from a flash, fading until there was only darkness.
The man was only half human, with a cyborg head and left arm. But the mechanics in his arm glowed pale red as they shone through clear plastic tubes carrying blood. 
The alley ran behind the entertainment district of Scraptown. No one like the dirty alleys but they surrounded the building like blood vessels, brining what was needed and taking away the waste.
The man ran from branching alley to branching alley. At each branch he'd stop and circle, like a hungry wild dog, chooing one on instinct and plunging into it.
"I'm gonna die. I'm gonna get eaten up."
The thought terrified him.
In his eyes the alley swelled, like the distended intestine of some great beast, swallowing him and everyting around him.
He screamed at this vision, but plungined on regardness. I can't turn back! The walls are covered in acid! They're gonna eat me and digest me. 
He stopped and clutched his head. It must be the drugs. If he could just squeeze his head.

    The man ran away running the night when the moonlight shone on.
    Alley of darkness without street lights. Sometimes the torpedo broken cup sparks burned the darkness with a pale white light. The light that diminishes and the figure of a man going crazy in the darkness float like an animation, and it disappears.
     The man was a half-body Saipog who mechanized part of his head and his left arm. In the machine arms there was an old naught of a big swing and a dark blood glucose was stained in it that glowed bluntly.
     Here is a zone away from the entertainment district of Kuzu Town, where only the dirty alleys, which are not popular, surround the gaps of buildings like capillaries.
The man ran without saying the thick and thin alley. Occasionally when the path is touched on the left and right side, like a hungry wild dog, he strokes his neck and jumps into one of the alleyways as I thought after a stroll.
"I will be killed, I will be melted"
The man was frightened by the illusion.
In the muddy eyes the alley swelled like a badly reddish beast's intestine and it looked like it was swallowing swallowing yourself.
The man screams at the phobia of phantom but crawls further into that alley without stopping. We can not turn back. It was because I was convinced that nearby walls will scatter acid and stop everything without trace once it stops.
If you squeeze a man's brain now, Alcaloid will come out like a fruit juice. It was withdrawal symptoms due to plant narcotics, bad trip.
Oh, the footsteps approached.
I am going to melt.
